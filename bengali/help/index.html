<p>This Unicode character picker allows you to produce or analyse runs of Bengali text. Character pickers are especially useful for people who don't know a script well, as characters are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>
<p>If something is broken or missing <a target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/issues/new?title=[bengali%20picker]%20%20ADD%20TITLE%20HERE">raise an issue</a>. For version information see <a  target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/commits/gh-pages/bengali">the Github commit list</a>.</p>


<section id="basics">
  <h2 href="#basics">Basic use</h2>
<p>To produce characters in the text area, click on character shapes, or use your keyboard for Latin characters, delete, etc. Then cut &amp; paste the result to your document, or use the controls to get further information about the characters. You must have JavaScript enabled. </p>
<p><b class="leadin">Sample text</b> If you want to see some sample text in the picker, and perhaps analyse it using the options above the text area, follow this link: <a target="_blank" href="../index?text=বাংলা"  lang="bn">বাংলা</a></p>
<p><b class="leadin">Fonts</b>
  To properly display the text you will need to choose a font that is loaded on your system or device, or use the web font downloaded with the page (Noto Sans Bengali, and Lohit Bengali). The font list indicates which fonts are standard for Mac (Snow Leopard/Lion) and Windows7. See more information about <a href="/scripts/fontlist/#bengali" target="_blank">standard OS fonts in Mac and Windows</a>.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Mobile devices</b>
When working on an iPad or similar device, you should turn off<code class="kw" translate="no"> Autofocus</code> (just below the text area). This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.  You may also need to select a character twice to add it to the output field.</p>
</section>

<section id="about">
<h2 href="#about">About the chart</h2>
      <p>Includes characters in the Unicode <a href="/uniview/?block=bengali" target="_blank">Bengali</a> block.     </p>
      <p>All text is output in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character - text pasted into the box won't be normalised until you click on another character above, or click on a button in the yellow area.</p>

<section id="text_area">
  <h3 href="#text_area">Text area</h3>
  <p><img src="images/text_area.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>This is where you see characters appearing as you select them from the panels lower down or where you paste text into the picker. Once you have some text here, you can perform various operations on it, or simply copy it to the clipboard for use elsewhere. </p>
  <p>The controls just above the text area allow you to interactive with the text in various ways. They mostly work on highlighted text within the text area, or if there is no highlight they work on all the text. Controls near the bottom of the picker allow you to change font, font size, line-height, text direction, etc.</p>
</section>



<section id="top_controls">
  <h3 href="#top_controls">Controls above the text area</h3>
      <p><img src="images/controls_above.png" alt=""/></p>
      <p>Controls above the input box allow you to run various operations on the text in the box. <strong>Most of them work on what you have selected</strong> within the box, or the whole box if nothing is selected.</p>
      
      <p><b class="leadin">Copy, select, delete (<img src="images/copy_etc.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt=""/>).</b>  The icons on the left above the input box allow you to copy the text to the clipboard, select the text or delete the text, respectively. </p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Show codepoints.</b> Produces a list of the Unicode code points in the input box. You can usually follow a link from a code point item to more detailed information about that character.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Convert to escapes.</b> Opens a new window for the converter app, which shows various different ways of representing the text in the input box using escapes.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">ISO 15919 to Bengali.</b> Converts text in the ISO 15919 transliteration to Bengali characters.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Bengali to ISO 15919.</b> Converts Bengali text to an ISO 15919 transliteration.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Radice to Bengali.</b> Converts text to Bengali characters from the transliteration used in Radice's book <cite>Teach Yourself Bengali</cite>.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Bengali to Radice.</b> Converts Bengali text to a Radice transliteration.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Make example.</b> This may be useful to speed up the creation of examples. You can create an example with four parts, delimited by /, in the following order: [1] Bengali text, [2] IPA transcription, [3] other transcription, [4] meaning. You don't need to add all four elements, but if you want to skip one in the middle of the sequence, use //.</p>
       <p>For example, the following:</p>
      <p>বাংলা লিপি//bangla lipi/Bengali script</p>
      <p>will produce:</p>
      <p style="text-align:left; text-justify:auto;"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;ex&quot; lang=&quot;bn&quot;&gt;বাংলা লিপি&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;bangla lipi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;Bengali script&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
      <p>To get just the Bengali and the second transcription you would use:</p>
       <p>বাংলা লিপি//bangla lipi</p>
       
      
      <p><b class="leadin">Character markup.</b> This may be useful to speed up the creation of markup for a specific character or set of characters. Select one or more characters in the text area, then click this button.  It will return something like the following for each of the characters:</p>
      <p style="text-align:left; text-justify:auto;"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;codepoint&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;bn&quot;&gt;&amp;#x09B2;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;uname&quot;&gt;U+09B2 BENGALI LETTER LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
      <p>When you add it to your document, it will look like this.</p>
      <p><span class="codepoint"><span lang="bn">&#x09B2;</span> <span class="uname">U+09B2 BENGALI LETTER LA</span></span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="secondary_output">Secondary text area</h3>
  <p><img src="images/secondary_text.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>This area receives the output of various tools. Note that the text is editable.</p>
  <p>The icons to the right ( <img src="images/second_copy_etc.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle;"/> ) allow you to copy the contents of this area to the clipboard, insert the contents into the main text area, or close this subwindow, respectively. When you insert the contents of this subwindow into the main text area, the text will overwrite any highlighted text, otherwise it will just be inserted at the current cursor position.</p>
  <p>Some conversions produce ambiguous output. In this case, you will be offered two alternatives on a yellow background, eg. <img src="images/alternatives.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;"/> presents you with the alternatives 'h' or 't'. Simply click on the alternative you want, and the picker will discard the rest.</p>
</section>

<section id="character_names">
  <h3 href="#character_names">Character names</h3>
  <p><img src="images/character_names.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>As you mouse over characters in the selection areas of the picker, you will see the code point and character name appear here. </p>
</section>

<section id="autofocus">
  <h3 href="#autofocus">Autofocus</h3>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="images/autofocus.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>When working on an iPad or similar device, you should set this to <samp>Off</samp>. This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.</p>
</section>

<section id="input_aids">
  <h3 href="#input_aids">Input aids</h3>
    <p><img src="images/input_aids.png" style="float:left; margin-right:1em; " alt=""/></p>
    <p>The vertical grey bar to the left allows you to turn on/off a number of panels that can help create the text you want.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Default.</b> Turns off all input aids and closes all panels.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Hinting.</b> Changes the selection area so that, when you mouse over a character, characters that are similar in appearance, and may be easily confused, are automatically highlighted. This can be particularly useful for people who are not familiar with the script, to avoid confusing similar characters, or to find the right character when two or more look similar.    </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Shape lookup.</b> This adds a row of orange pictures that represent basic shapes associated with the Bengali characters. When you click on a picture, characters that incorporate that shape are highlighted. This is particularly helpful for those who don't know the script at all and want to pick characters based on their shape, or for those times when you just can't find the character you want and need a hint.</p>
    <p>In addition to highlighting characters in the table above, this picker suggests matches for a shape in the more common conjuncts for Bengali. This helps, since conjunct combinations are very common in Bengali text. Conjuncts associated with a given shape are displayed below the orange shape selectors. Just click on one to add it to the output area.</p>
    <p>Note that where the shape of the  characters involved in a cluster doesn't really change I don't usually list the combination here. You should search for the two shapes and add a virama between them. For example, some clusters are indicated by bringing two characters close together, eg. compare <img src="../images/closeconj1.png" alt="conjunct"> with <img src="../images/closeconj2.png" alt="not a conjunct">. Also, conjuncts ending in YA <img src="../images/yaconj.png" alt="trailing ya"> are excluded: use the combining YA from the table above. The same goes for the initial RA, which ends up as a superscript <img src="../images/rephconj.png" alt="reph">.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Latin characters.</b> Displays a panel of lowercase Latin characters you are likely to need for  transcription.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">ISO 15919 to Bengali.</b> Displays a panel that allows you to generate some Bengali text from an ISO 15919 transcription  (from the main table <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/stone-catend/trind.htm">here</a>). Where there are multiple possible choices, these choices are presented in a small pop-up box; click on the choice you want to insert it into the output area.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Radice to Bengali.</b> Displays a panel that allows you to generate some Bengali text from a transcription in the book <cite>Teach Yourself Bengali</cite>, by William Radice. The same mechanism is available to deal with ambiguity.</p>
</section>
<section id="buttons">
  <h3 href="#buttons">Selection area</h3>
  <p><img src="images/selection_area.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Click on characters or buttons in this area to add them to the  text area above.</p>
  <p>Characters are arranged based on the order of input, to speed up picking. Consonants are in a modified Indian articulatory arrangement, to the left. To their right are all the other characters. Independent vowels are at the top. Below these are the vowel signs and combining characters. The line below the combining characters contains punctuation. To the far right you will find numbers 0-9 and the currency symbol.</p>
  <p>Open the expanding link for obsoleted and other less commonly used characters.</p>
</section>
<section id="yellow_controls">
  <h3 href="#yellow_controls">Controls on the yellow background</h3>
    <p><img src="images/yellow_controls.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Left-hand controls.</b> These controls at the bottom of the page allow you to modify fonts used, the font size, line height, and the height of the text area. </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Add codepoint.</b> You can add characters to the text area by typing codepoints and escapes in the <samp>Add codepoint</samp> field and hitting return. This will accept HTML numeric character references, javascript and other programming escapes, U+ Unicode notation, or just simple codepoint numbers separated by spaces. All codepoint numbers (including those in escapes) must be hexadecimal.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Search for. </b>If you are searching for a particular character and know (at least part of) the name or the codepoint, type that in the search box and hit return. All characters with matching text in the name or codepoint number will be highlighted. The highlighting is only removed when you click on the <samp translate="no">X</samp> next to the search input field. You can also use regular expression syntax to improve your search results. For example, to find the letter 'ha', but not 'gha' etc, you can use <kbd  translate="no">\bha\b</kbd> (or the shortcut, <kbd  translate="no">:ha:</kbd>).</p>
</section>
<section id="more_controls">
  <h3 href="#more_controls">More controls</h3>
  <p><img src="images/more_controls.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Click on <samp>more controls</samp> to reveal the less commonly used controls described here.</p>
  <p><b class="leadin">Normalise. </b>All text is added to the main text area in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character – text pasted into the box won't be normalised until you click on another character above, or click on a button in the yellow area. </p>
  <p><b class="leadin">Change table font. </b>Allows you to change the font and size of the characters you click on in the main selection areas. </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">CC base.</b> You would normally expect combining characters, such as accents and vowel signs, when displayed alone to be associated with a dotted circle, however these font glyphs are <a href="http://rishida.net/blog/?p=1433">handled inconsistently</a> from one browser/font to the next. The picker is set up for a given web font initially, but if you change the table font you may need to do something to ensure that combining characters display in a way that helps you click on them. </p>
    <p>The <samp class="kw" translate="no">CC base</samp> control allows you to specify a base character that will be used before each combining character (or no base character). This should hopefully help for most font and browser combinations.</p>
