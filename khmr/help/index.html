<p>This Unicode character app allows you to produce or analyse runs of Khmer text. character apps are especially useful for people who don't know a script well, as characters are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>
<p>If something is broken or missing <a target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/issues/new?title=[khmer%20picker]%20%20ADD%20TITLE%20HERE">raise an issue</a>. For version information see <a  target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/commits/gh-pages/khmer">the Github commit list</a>. The pictures of the UI used in this page are taken from a variety of character apps.</p>






<section id="about">
<h2 href="#about">Inputting characters</h2>
<p>The app includes characters in the Unicode <a href="/uniview/?block=khmer" target="_blank">Khmer</a> and <a href="/uniview/?block=khmer_symbols" target="_blank">Khmer Symbols</a> blocks (in the default panel) that are used for writing text in the  Khmer language. </p>

<p>To <strong><em>analyse</em> text</strong>, copy &amp; paste it into the large text area and select the desired control(s).</p>
<p>To <strong><em>produce</em> Khmer text</strong> in the text area, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type on your keyboard, using type-assist</strong>. A quick way to input text from ASCII characters on your keyboard, based on a Latin transcription.</li>
<li><strong>Open the shape-based input, and click</strong> on similar shapes to highlight characters you may be looking for. Good when you don't know the orthography well.</li>
<li><strong>Click on the characters in the selection area</strong>. The blocks are arranged to assist with input, and groups of characters are arranged within a block phonetically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are  described in more detail elsewhere on this page.</p>
<p>Click on <samp>SUBJ</samp> to show subjoined forms of consonants. This may be useful for spotting shapes. When you click on these, a <span class="name">coeng</span> is automatically inserted into the text area – there is no need to click on that separately.</p>

<!-- TRANSLITERATE AND MAKE VOCAB TEXT -->

<p><b class="leadin">Transliterate.</b> Converts the contents of the text area to a Latin transliteration that provides a one-to-one correspondence between  Khmer and Latin symbols.</p>
<p>The transliteration scheme  was developed for this character app, and, where possible, uses  symbols that represent sounds typically associated with their Khmer equivalents, rather than the sometimes fairly arbitrary selection of diacritics found in other systems. Of course, the complexities of mapping graphemes to sounds means that this is far from a real phonetic transcription,  and it doesn't show inherent vowels, but the process is reversible (unlike most  transcriptions).</p>
<p>Transliterations produced this way are particularly useful for understanding the composition of text in  scripts, where the individual parts are not well separated in the text.</p>



<p><b class="leadin">Make vocab.</b> This helps speed up the creation of entries for the <a href="../../../app-vocab/">vocabulary app</a>. You can create a vocab item with up to 5 parts, delimited by / or |, in the following order: </p>
<ol>
<li>native text</li>
<li>meaning</li>
<li>transcription (IPA or other, optional)</li>
<li>alternative transcription (if needed)</li>
<li>notes (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the time, only the first 2 items are needed. In this app if an IPA transcription is not supplied it will be added automatically, though it should be checked carefully.</p>
<p>Here is an example of before and after.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="km">មេឃ</span>/sky</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code><span lang="km">មេឃ</span>|sky|meːk</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The app will also, simultaneously, produce markup for examples in the secondary text area (see below).</p>
<p>If you have more than one line of text in the text area, you must highlight the line you want to convert. Only convert one line at a time.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Vocab to markup.</b> Converts a vocab entry to markup that can be used for an example. Must be applied to one line at a time.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="km">មេឃ</span>|sky|meːk</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code>&lt;span class=&quot;charExample&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;bdi class=&quot;ex&quot; lang=&quot;km&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;<span lang="km">មេឃ</span>&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;m̱eḵʰ&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class=&quot;ipa&quot;&gt;meːk&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;sky&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b class="leadin">Khmer to UNGEGN.</b> <strong>This is still in development!</strong> Converts Khmer text into a transcription along the lines of the UNGEGN system. It still needs a lot of work.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Show syllables.</b> This control attempts to split the Khmer text into  syllables, so that an IPA transcription can be attempted. It is still in the prototype stage.</p>
<p>Because the algorithm for IPA conversion works on phonetic syllables, rather than  orthographic ones, in order to produce an automatic IPA transcription (see below) you'll need to additionally do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any spaces separating syllable-final consonants that would otherwise be regarded as having an inherent vowel. There will probably always be problems distinguishing these consonants, due to the ambiguities of the Khmer writing system. Simply delete the space between the two parts of the syllable.</li>
<li>Because phonetic rules for multisyllabic words need to know what makes up the word, you'll need to add a hyphen instead of a space between syllables that make up a single word.</li>
</ol>
<p><b class="leadin">Khmer to IPA.</b> Produces an output that is intended to <strong>approximately</strong> reflect actual pronunciation. It uses the rules in Franklin Huffman's <em>Cambodian System of Writing</em>. <strong><em>However, it needs some assistance from the user</em></strong>. This is because Khmer doesn't use spaces between words, and it is often ambiguous as to whether a consonant represents a syllable-final sound or a syllable in its own right. It also needs help to identify unstressed syllables. You should find that the <samp>Show syllables</samp> control helps to prepare the text (see above).</p>
<p>After the first syllable on the line, put an ordinary space before each consonant or independent vowel sign that begins a new <em>syllable</em> (not word). (Note that this may split consonant clusters. The Khmer text will look strange but still work.) You should also indicate unstressed syllables by following the syllable with a hyphen, rather than a space. For many bisyllabic words, this means putting a hyphen after the first of the two syllables. For example, converting <span class="khmer" lang="km">ប្រកាន់និទៀន</span> to <span class="khmer" lang="km">ប្រ-កាន់ និ-ទៀន</span> will produce the following transcription <span class="ipa">prɑkannitiən</span>. Note that, if you don't know Khmer well enough to know when a syllable is unstressed, you can still get an approximation to the pronunciation using only spaces. For instance, the previous example separated by spaces only will yield <span class="ipa">prɑːkanniʔtiən</span>.    </p>
<p>Although the transcription is based on rules by Franklin Huffman in <em>Cambodian System of Writing</em>, some symbols are changed to be more recognizable to those familiar with IPA. While the transcription rules are quite detailed, and Khmer is largely regular, there are a few exceptions, particularly in words from Sanskrit or Pali,  or ambiguities, for example in a few independent vowel signs, that cause problems for the transcription. The transcription is non-reversible. I created it to help me quickly reproduce (simple) phonetic alternatives for examples in my notes on Khmer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Remove space/hyphen.</b> Removes the spaces from the highlighted range (or the whole output area, if nothing is highlighted).</p>

<p><b class="leadin">[H] Huffman to Khmer.</b> Allows you to generate Khmer text from a transcription as used by Huffman in <cite>Cambodian System of Writing</cite>. It works as described in the section just above about <samp>Reverse transliteration</samp>, but uses a different panel to set up the <strong>transcription type-in mode</strong>.</p>
<p> A hyphen in a selection list for either of this or the following transcription panels indicates that the sound is produced without a Khmer character, ie. the inherent vowel.</p>
<p> In a small number of cases, you will need to click twice on the components that make up the sound (eg. when bantoc is used on the following consonant). These cases are indicated by a red plus sign between two clickable shapes (one of which may be just a hyphen). You need to click on the item to the left of the plus sign, then add a consonant, then click on the item to the right of the plus sign. In several cases the item to the left is a hyphen (representing the inherent vowel), in which case just add another consonant followed by the item to the right.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">[G] Gilbert to Khmer.</b> Allows you to generate Khmer text from a transcription as used by Gilbert and Hang in <cite>Cambodian for Beginners</cite>. It works as described in the section just above about <samp>Reverse transliteration</samp>, but uses a different panel to set up the <strong>transcription type-in mode</strong>.</p>
