<p>This Unicode character app allows you to produce or analyse runs of Old Norse text. Character apps are especially useful for people who don't know a script well, as characters are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>
<p>If something is broken or missing <a target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/issues/new?title=[oldnorse%20character app]%20%20ADD%20TITLE%20HERE">raise an issue</a>. For version information see <a  target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/commits/gh-pages/oldnorse">the Github commit list</a>. The pictures of the UI used in this page are taken from a variety of character apps.</p>


<section id="about">
<h2 href="#about">Inputting characters</h2>
<p>Includes characters  that are used for writing Old Norse.</p>

<p>To <strong><em>analyse</em> text</strong>, copy &amp; paste it into the large text area and select the desired control(s).</p>
<p>To <strong><em>produce</em> Old Norse text</strong> in the text area, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type on your keyboard, using type-assist</strong>. A quick way to input text from ASCII characters on your keyboard, based on a Latin transcription.</li>
<!--<li><strong>Open the shape-based input, and click</strong> on similar shapes to highlight characters you may be looking for. Good when you don't know the orthography well.</li>-->
<li><strong>Click on the characters in the selection area</strong>. The blocks are arranged to assist with input, and groups of characters are arranged within a block phonetically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are  described in more detail elsewhere on this page.</p>
<p>Click on <samp>SHIFT</samp> to toggle between lower- and uppercase in the selection area.</p>

<!-- TRANSLITERATE AND MAKE VOCAB TEXT -->




<!--
<p><b class="leadin">Make vocab.</b> This helps speed up the creation of entries for the <a href="../../../app-vocab/">vocabulary app</a>. You can create a vocab item with up to 5 parts, delimited by / or |, in the following order: </p>
<ol>
<li>native text</li>
<li>meaning</li>
<li>transcription (IPA or other, optional)</li>
<li>alternative transcription (if needed)</li>
<li>notes (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the time, only the first 2 items are needed. In this app if an IPA transcription is not supplied it will be added automatically, though it should be checked carefully.</p>
<p>Here is an example of before and after.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>/sky</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code><span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>|sky|meÀêk</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The app will automatically generate a Latin transcription in parentheses if the Latin orthography differs from the IPA.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="fuf">û§ºû§Æû§©û§Æ</span>|rain</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code><span lang="fuf">û§ºû§Æû§©û§Æ</span>|rain|t…î…ì…î (to…ìo)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The app will also, simultaneously, produce markup for examples in the secondary text area (see below).</p>
<p>If you have more than one line of text in the text area, you must highlight the line you want to convert. Only convert one line at a time.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Vocab to markup.</b> Converts a vocab entry to markup that can be used for an example. Must be applied to one line at a time.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>|sky|meÀêk</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code>&lt;span class=&quot;charExample&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;bdi class=&quot;ex&quot; lang=&quot;km&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;<span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;mÃ±e·∏µ ∞&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class=&quot;ipa&quot;&gt;meÀêk&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;sky&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b class="leadin">General notes on transcriptions.</b> In addition to helping you to type Old Norse latin-based text, the character app allows you to automatically generate phonetic and runic transcriptions. These should be used with caution! The phonetic transcriptions are only intended to be a rough guide, and real-life runic text is often highly idiosyncratic, not to mention that it varies depending on the time period.</p>
<p>The runic transcription tools in this app produce runes of the Younger fu√æark ‚Äì used for Old Norse after the Elder and before the Medieval fu√æarks. This transcription tool has its own idiosyncracies, that may not always match real-life usage of runes. One particular idiosyncracy is that the output always regularly conforms to the same set of rules, but others include the inability to produce things such as ligatures (bind-runes), and the decision not to remove homorganic nasals before certain following letters. More information about this is given below.</p>
<p>Note that there is also a <a href="/pickers/runic/" target="_blank">Runic character app</a>, which deals with conventional latin transliterations, and includes characters from a wider range of fu√æarks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Old Norse to IPA.</b> This produces a very rough phonemic transcription of the highlighted text in the box. The transcription appears just below the input box, where you can copy it, move it into the input box at the caret, or delete it. The transcription is generated using rules from <cite>A New Introduction to Old Norse</cite>.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Old Norse to LB Runes.</b> This produces a runic transcription from Old Norse standardised orthography or from the standardised Latin transcription of runes. It produces a transcription using the long branch variant of the younger fu√æark. Specific features of the transcription include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> homorganic nasals are not removed before relevant following letters</li>
<li>doubled consonants in the latin transcription are reduced to a single character in runic</li>
<li>multiple sequential occurrences of a rune are reduced to a single occurrence, eg. <span lang="non">√òyvind</span> becomes <span lang="non-runr">·ö¢·õÅ·öæ·õè</span> not <span lang="non-runr">·ö¢·ö¢·ö¢·õÅ·öæ·õè</span>. This is normal in runic text, but not invariably the case (eg. the runic version of <span lang="non">D√≥u</span> as <span lang="non-runr">·õè·ö¢·ö¢</span> in the Gripsholm inscription).</li>
<li>ei is transcribed as the two characters <span lang="non-runr">·õÖ·õÅ</span>, but single latin vowel characters do not produce digraphs in the runic output.</li>
<li>unless √£ and  Ä are included in the latin text, the respective runes, <span lang="non-runr">·ö®</span> and <span lang="non-runr">·õ¶</span>, are not produced in the output.</li>
<li> latin sequences such as <span lang="non">aÕ°u</span> do not produce ligated bind-runes (since they cannot be represented using Unicode).</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="leadin">Old Norse to ST Runes.</b> This produces a runic transcription from Old Norse standardised orthography or from the standardised Latin transcription of runes into the short twig variant of the younger fu√æark. Specific features of the transcription are the same as those for the long branch transcription.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Transcribe from NION.</b> The online PDF version of <cite>A New Introduction to Old Norse</cite> has strange encoding quirks, for example representing √∞ as ‚Ä∫ and √æ as fl. If you copy paste text from the PDF into the output box, you can use this feature to convert the text into Unicode. One warning: fi is converted to √û, but occasionally it is meant to represent fi.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Glossary lookup.</b> Basically, this does the opposite of the previous feature, converting Unicode to a form that will match entries in the <cite>New Introduction to Old Norse</cite> glossary. It also opens the glossary page in a separate window. Unfortunately, the search parameter in the URL doesn't take you to the exact location needed in the document, but you could pick up the text from the URL to use for a search.</p>

<!-- OTHER INPUT AIDS -->

<p><b class="leadin">[T] Type assist.</b> Allows you to generate text  from QWERTY input. This can also be switched on/off by hitting the ` (backquote) key, but <strong>it is on by default</strong> when you open the character app.</p>
<p>You should find that very little practise is needed to learn to enter  text quickly. This method is much faster than picking items from the selection area below.</p>
<p>When there are alternatives, the app will allow you to select characters from a list. For each alternative you'll see the character to be inserted in red. To its left you'll see pronunciation information for that character (in grey, above), and the number key to press (in orange, below) to insert the character into the text box.  You can also just tap on the character (often more useful when using hand-held devices).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../shared26/images/help/latin_type_assist.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This sets up the <strong>Transcription type-in mode</strong>, which means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a key on the keyboard is only associated with a single native character, that character will be inserted immediately.</li>
<li>If there are alternatives but you continue typing, the app will replace the character you typed with the character assigned to the number 0.</li>
</ol>

<p><b class="leadin">[M] More Latin characters.</b> Displays a panel of  Latin characters you are likely to need for  typing Old Norse or for various transcriptions. This can also be switched on/off by hitting the ~ (tilde) key.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../shared26/images/help/latin-panel.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you type the orange characters, suggestions for input will appear at the bottom of the text area. To insert one of those items into the text area at the cursor position, type the appropriate number key, or tap directly on the item you want to insert. The character you typed will be replaced by the item you selected. (If you already see the character you want, just continue typing.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../shared26/images/help/character-selector.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Because this sets up the <strong>Latin type-in mode</strong>, alternative characters are <strong>only</strong> inserted after you press on a number key.</p>
<p>In general, alternative characters are associated with a key on the keyboard that resembles them when displayed - eg. …£ will usually be brought up by pressing on the 'y' key (rather than, say 'g').</p>

<p><b class="leadin">[K] Keyboard.</b> Allows you to type characters by selecting them from a keyboard layout.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">[S] Show case endings.</b> Clicking on this reveals a tool that summarises basic noun case endings in Old Norse. Mouse over the ending of a noun and it will indicate some possible cases that it represents. Of course, this is very simplistic.</p>
