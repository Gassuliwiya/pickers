<section>
  <h2 id="text_area">Text area</h2>
  <p>This is where you see characters appearing as you select them from the panels lower down or where you paste text into the picker. Once you have some text here, you can perform various operations on it, or simply copy it to the clipboard for use elsewhere.</p>
  <p>The controls just above the text area allow you to interactive with the text in various ways. They mostly work on highlighted text within the text area, or if there is no highlight they work on all the text. Controls near the bottom of the picker allow you to change font, font size, line-height, text direction, etc.</p>
<p>You can use the <code class="kw" translate="no">RLO/PDF</code> buttons below the keyboard to make the runic text run right-to-left, eg. <span style="font-family: Junicode, sans-serif;">‮ᚹᚪᚱᚦᚷᚪ‬</span>, and if you have the right font (such as Junicode or a Babelstone font), make the glyphs face to the left also. The <a href="http://babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/AngloSaxon.html">Bablestone fonts</a> also implement a number of bind-runes for Anglo-Saxon (but are missing some for Old Norse, it seems) if you put a ZWJ character between the characters you want to ligate. For example: <span style="font-family: 'Bablestone Runic Beorhtric', 'Babelstone Runic Beagnoth';" lang="asc">ᚻ‍ᛖ‍ᛚ</span>. You can also produce two glyphs mirrored around the central stave by putting ZWJ between two identical characters, eg. <span style="font-family: 'Bablestone Runic Beorhtric', 'Babelstone Runic Beagnoth';" lang="asc">ᚢ‍ᚢ</span>.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="top_controls">Controls above the text area</h2>
      <p>Controls above the input box allow you to run various operations on the text in the box. <strong>Most of them work on what you have selected</strong> within the box, or the whole box if nothing is selected.</p>
      
      <p><b class="leadin">Copy, select, delete (<img src="images/copy_etc.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt=""/>).</b>  The icons on the left above the input box allow you to copy the text to the clipboard, select the text or delete the text, respectively. </p>
      <p><span class="leadin">Show codepoints.</span> Produces a list of the Unicode code points in the input box. You can usually follow a link from a code point item to more detailed information about that character.</p>
      <p><span class="leadin">Convert to escapes.</span> Opens a new window for the converter app, which shows various different ways of representing the text in the input box using escapes.</p>
  <p><span class="leadin">Transliterate LB/ST runes.</span> Produces a transliteration of runic text written in the Younger Fuþark (either Long Branch or Short Twig versions).</p>
      <p><span class="leadin">Transliterate Medieval runes.</span> Produces a transliteration of runic text written in the Medieval Fuþark.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Latin to LB Runes.</span> Converts a latin transliteration into runic text, using the Long Branch variants of the Younger Fuþark.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Latin to ST Runes.</span> Converts a latin transliteration into runic text, using the Short Twig variants of the Younger Fuþark.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Latin to Medieval Runes.</span> Converts a latin transliteration into runic text, using the Medieval Fuþark.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Latin to AS/F Runes.</span> Converts a latin transliteration into runic text, using the Anglo-Saxon/Frisian Fuþorc.</p>
      <p><span class="leadin">Transcribe from NION.</span> The online PDF version of A New Introduction to Old Norse (such as <a href="http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/NION%20II-2011.pdf">the reader</a>) has strange encoding quirks, for example representing ð as › and þ as fl. If you copy paste text from the PDF into the output box, you can use this feature to convert the text into Unicode. One warning: fi is converted to Þ, but occasionally it is meant to represent fi.</p>
      
  <p><span class="leadin">Make example.</span> This may be useful to speed up the creation of examples. You can create an example with four parts, delimited by /, in the following order: [1] Runic text, [2] IPA transcription, [3] other transcription, [4] meaning. You don't need to add all four elements, but if you want to skip one in the middle of the sequence, use //.</p>
  <p><span class="leadin">Character markup.</span> This may be useful to speed up the creation of markup for a specific character or set of characters. Select one or more characters in the text area, then click this button.  It will return something like the following for each of the characters:</p>
<p style="text-align:left; text-justify:auto;"><code>&lt;span class="uname"&gt;U+16A0 RUNIC LETTER FEHU FEOH FE F&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span lang="non"&gt;&amp;#x16A0;&lt;/span&gt;)</code></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="secondary_output">Secondary text area</h2>
  <p>This area receives the output of various controls. Note that the text is editable.</p>
  <p>The icons to the right ( <img src="images/second_copy_etc.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle;"/> ) allow you to copy the contents of this area to the clipboard, insert the contents into the main text area, or close this subwindow, respectively. When you insert the contents of this subwindow into the main text area, the text will overwrite any highlighted text, otherwise it will just be inserted at the current cursor position.</p>
  <p>Some conversions produce ambiguous output. In this case, you will be offered two alternatives on a yellow background, eg. <img src="images/alternatives.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;"/> presents you with the alternatives 'h' or 't'. Simply click on the alternative you want, and the picker will discard the rest.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="character_names">Character names</h2>
  <p>As you mouse over characters in the selection areas of the picker, you will see the code point and character name appear here. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="autofocus">Autofocus</h2>
  <p>When working on an iPad or similar device, you should set this to <samp>Off</samp>. This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="input_aids">Input aids</h2>
    <p>The vertical grey bar to the left allows you to turn on/off a number of panels that can help create the text you want.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Default.</span> Turns off all input aids and closes all panels.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Transliteration characters.</span> Displays a panel of  characters you may need while typing in a transliteration of runic text from the keyboard. The Latin keyboard also provides all of these characters.</p>
<p>Note that the Latin characters provided in this picker are for standard <strong>transliterations</strong> of runes, and you may need different characters to represent transcriptions into actual Old Norse or Anglo-Saxon, etc, text. (For that, see the <a href="/pickers/oldnorse/">Old Norse</a> and <a href="/pickers/oldenglish/">Old English</a> pickers.</p>
<p><span class="leadin">IPA characters.</span> Displays a panel of  characters you may need while typing in an IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcription from the keyboard.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="buttons">Selection area</h2>
  <p>Click on characters or buttons in this area to add them to the  text area above.</p>
  <p> Various keyboard arrangements are available, providing access to runes used for the Elder Fuþark, Younger Fuþark (Long Branch and Short Twig variants), Medieval Fuþark, and Anglo-Saxon Fuþork. There is also a layout that includes the Latin characters used for transliterations of the runic text. Use the buttons below the keyboard to switch between these alternatives.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="yellow_controls">Controls on the yellow background</h2>
    <p><b class="leadin">Left-hand controls.</b> These controls at the bottom of the page allow you to modify fonts used, the font size, line height, and the height of the text area. </p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Add codepoint.</span> You can add characters to the text area by typing codepoints and escapes in the <samp>Add codepoint</samp> field and hitting return. This will accept HTML numeric character references, javascript and other programming escapes, U+ Unicode notation, or just simple codepoint numbers separated by spaces. All codepoint numbers (including those in escapes) must be hexadecimal.</p>
    <p><span class="leadin">Search for. </span>If you are searching for a particular character and know (at least part of) the name or the codepoint, type that in the search box and hit return. All characters with matching text in the name or codepoint number will be highlighted. The highlighting is only removed when you click on the <samp translate="no">X</samp> next to the search input field. You can also use regular expression syntax to improve your search results. For example, to find the letter 'ha', but not 'gha' etc, you can use <kbd  translate="no">\bha\b</kbd> (or the shortcut, <kbd  translate="no">:ha:</kbd>).</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="more_controls">More controls</h2>
  <p>Click on <samp>more controls</samp> to reveal the less commonly used controls described here.</p>
  <p><b class="leadin">Normalise. </b>All text is added to the main text area in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character – text pasted into the box won't be normalised until you click on another character above, or click on a button in the yellow area. </p>
  <p><b class="leadin">Change table font. </b>Allows you to change the font and size of the characters you click on in the main selection areas. </p>
    <p><span class="leadin">CC base.</span> You would normally expect combining characters, such as accents and vowel signs, when displayed alone to be associated with a dotted circle, however these font glyphs are <a href="http://rishida.net/blog/?p=1433">handled inconsistently</a> from one browser/font to the next. The picker is set up for a given web font initially, but if you change the table font you may need to do something to ensure that combining characters display in a way that helps you click on them. </p>
    <p>The <samp class="kw" translate="no">CC base</samp> control allows you to specify a base character that will be used before each combining character (or no base character). This should hopefully help for most font and browser combinations.</p>
