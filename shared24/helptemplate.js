<p>To produce characters in the text area, click on character shapes, or use your keyboard for Latin characters, delete, etc. Then cut &amp; paste the result to your document, or use the controls to get further information about the characters. You must have JavaScript enabled. </p>
<p>The controls just above the text area allow you to interact with the text in various ways. <strong>They nearly all work on highlighted text within the text area, or if there is no highlight, on all the text.</strong> Controls near the bottom of the app allow you to change font, font size, line-height, text direction, etc.</p>
<p><b class="leadin" id="contrast">Contrast.</b> To change the contrast level for the text on the app user interface, click on the <img src="../../images/contrast.png" alt="plus sign"/> icon, found at the top right of the page. If you chose to save your settings between sessions, this will also be remembered.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Sample text.</b> If you want to add some sample text to the text area, click on the <img src="../../images/sample.png" alt="plus sign"/> icon.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Fonts.</b>
To properly display the text you will need to choose a font that is loaded on your system or device, or use the web fonts downloaded with the page (the names end in ' WF'). Where applicable, the font list indicates which fonts are standard for Mac and Windows operating systems, and fonts that are freely available from Google and SIL. See more information about <a href="/scripts/fontlist/#khmer" target="_blank">standard OS fonts in Mac and Windows</a>.</p>
<p><b class="leadin" id="autofocus">Autofocus &amp; mobile devices.</b>
When working on an iPad or similar device, you should turn off <code class="kw" translate="no">Autofocus</code> (just below the text area). This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.  You may also need to select a character twice to add it to the output field.</p>
`
if (direction === 'rtl') out += `<p><b class="leadin">Text direction</b> The characters ‚Üí ‚Üî ‚ÜêÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏é (just below the right side of the text area) allow you to set the base direction of the text area to LTR, auto, and RTL, respectively. The symbol ‚áêÔ∏é sets the direction to RTL override.</p>
<p>In some character apps you will also see the symbol ‚≠ÖÔ∏é . This mirrors the character glyph at the same time as applying a RTL override.</p>

<p><b class="leadin" id="translit">Transliteration vs transcription.</b> Character apps distinguish between transliteration and transcription. In <strong>transliteration</strong> each native character has an equivalent Latin character associated with it. The transliteration may not accurately represent pronunciation, but does allow straightforward and reversible conversion between the two scripts. One transliteration scheme is chosen as the default for the app (usually a method designed by myself), and the app has controls to convert to and from that transliteration. A <strong>transcription</strong>, on the other hand, is more likely to be phonetically accurate (though may still reflect only an approximation), and is likely not to allow reversible conversions.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Normalisation.</b> All text is output in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character - text pasted into the box won't be normalised until you click on another character above, or click on a button in the yellow area.</p>

    <li>If you continue typing, the app will insert the character assigned to the number 0 in place of the character you typed. (If you want to type Latin characters, switch to the Latin type-in mode. See <samp>Latin characters</samp> above.)</li>

    </ol>
    <p>You should find that very little practise is needed to learn to enter native text quickly. This method is much faster than picking items from the selection area below.</p>
