<p>This Unicode character app allows you to produce or analyse runs of Turoyo text. character apps are especially useful for people who don't know a script well, as characters are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>

<section id="about">
<h2 href="#about">About the app</h2>
      <p>Includes characters in the Unicode <a href="/uniview/?block=syriac">Syriac</a> block that are used for the Turoyo (Surayt) language, as described by the <a href="https://textbook.surayt.com/en/Level%20A/0?content-fragment-id=2454"><span lang="tru">ܫܠܳܡܐ ܣܘܪܰܝܬ</span> Šlomo Surayt</a> project. </p>
<p>The site introduction includes the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surayt is a Neo-Aramaic language originally spoken in Turabdin, a region in southeastern Turkey, traditionally inhabited by Syriac Christians. In academia, Surayt has also become known as “Turoyo”. However, the speakers themselves have not accepted this academic term. They usually call their language Surayt. This term goes back to Classical Syriac Suryå'īṯ and means “Syriac” or “the way Syrians speak”. Today in Europe, many speakers simply use the term Suryoyo for their language. In this course, we have chosen to use the term Surayt because its speakers in Turabdin traditionally used it. It can also be used alongside the term Turoyo, which has been more in use among Western scholars.</p>
<p>Surayt spoken in the diaspora is not the same as any of the local dialects in Turabdin. The language presented in Šlomo Surayt is a slightly unified version of Surayt, which developed in the diaspora, and which can be considered as unique for its new context. Today, only about 1,500 people in the area of origin in Turabdin speak Surayt. However, in the European diaspora more than 250,000 people call it their “mother tongue”. Surayt is not a dialect of Classical-Syriac (kṯobonoyo), which is still used as liturgical language in Syriac churches. Within the Neo-Aramaic languages, Surayt is classified as Eastern Neo-Aramaic, which also includes the Jewish and other Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects of Iraq and Iran.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Transliterate.</b> Converts the contents of the text area to a Latin transliteration that provides a one-to-one correspondence between  Turoyo and Latin symbols.</p>
<p>The transliteration scheme  was developed for this character app, and, where possible, uses  symbols that represent sounds typically associated with their Turoyo equivalents, rather than the sometimes fairly arbitrary selection of diacritics found in other systems. Of course, the complexities of mapping graphemes to sounds means that this is far from a real phonetic transcription,  and it doesn't show short vowels in unvowelled text, but the process is reversible (unlike most  transcriptions).</p>
<p>Transliterations produced this way are particularly useful for understanding the composition of text in  scripts, where the individual parts are not well separated in the text.</p>
<!--p><b class="leadin">Transcribe.</b> <strong></strong>Converts the contents of the text area to a Latin transcription based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Latin_alphabet">Uyghur Latin alphabet</a>. This is not easily reversible.</p-->

    <!--p><b class="leadin">Transcript to IPA.</b> Displays a panel of  Latin characters.  As you click on those characters the character app inserts an equivalent IPA sound into the text area. Note that this produces <strong>only very approximate </strong> phonological transcriptions! It's mainly meant to be a way to interpret the intended sound of the transcription characters.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Transcript to Syriac.</b> Displays another panel of  Latin characters.  As you click on those characters the character app interprets them as transcription characters and inserts a corresponding syriac character into the text area. There may be occasions when you need to adjust the input, but it works pretty well most of the time.</p-->
