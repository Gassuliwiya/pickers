<p>This Unicode character app allows you to produce or analyse runs of Turoyo text. character apps are especially useful for people who don't know a script well, as characters are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://textbook.surayt.com/en/Level%20A/0?content-fragment-id=2454"><span lang="tru">‹´‹†‹≥‹°‹ê ‹£‹ò‹™‹∞‹ù‹¨</span> ≈†lomo Surayt</a> site introduction includes the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surayt is a Neo-Aramaic language originally spoken in Turabdin, a region in southeastern Turkey, traditionally inhabited by Syriac Christians. In academia, Surayt has also become known as ‚ÄúTuroyo‚Äù. However, the speakers themselves have not accepted this academic term. They usually call their language Surayt. This term goes back to Classical Syriac Sury√•'ƒ´·πØ and means ‚ÄúSyriac‚Äù or ‚Äúthe way Syrians speak‚Äù. Today in Europe, many speakers simply use the term Suryoyo for their language. In this course, we have chosen to use the term Surayt because its speakers in Turabdin traditionally used it. It can also be used alongside the term Turoyo, which has been more in use among Western scholars.</p>
<p>Surayt spoken in the diaspora is not the same as any of the local dialects in Turabdin. The language presented in ≈†lomo Surayt is a slightly unified version of Surayt, which developed in the diaspora, and which can be considered as unique for its new context. Today, only about 1,500 people in the area of origin in Turabdin speak Surayt. However, in the European diaspora more than 250,000 people call it their ‚Äúmother tongue‚Äù. Surayt is not a dialect of Classical-Syriac (k·πØobonoyo), which is still used as liturgical language in Syriac churches. Within the Neo-Aramaic languages, Surayt is classified as Eastern Neo-Aramaic, which also includes the Jewish and other Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects of Iraq and Iran.</p>

<section id="about">
<h2 href="#about">Inputting characters</h2>
<p>Includes characters in the Unicode <a href="/uniview/?block=syriac">Syriac</a> block that are used for the Turoyo (Surayt) language, as described by the <a href="https://textbook.surayt.com/en/Level%20A/0?content-fragment-id=2454"><span lang="tru">‹´‹†‹≥‹°‹ê ‹£‹ò‹™‹∞‹ù‹¨</span> ≈†lomo Surayt</a> project. </p>

<p>To <strong><em>analyse</em> text</strong>, copy &amp; paste it into the large text area and select the desired control(s).</p>
<p>To <strong><em>produce</em> Turoyo text</strong> in the text area, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type on your keyboard, using type-assist</strong>. A quick way to input text from ASCII characters on your keyboard, based on a Latin transcription.</li>
<li><strong>Open the shape-based input, and click</strong> on similar shapes to highlight characters you may be looking for. Good when you don't know the orthography well.</li>
<li><strong>Click on the characters in the selection area</strong>. The blocks are arranged to assist with input, and groups of characters are arranged within a block phonetically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are  described in more detail elsewhere on this page.</p>
<p>Click on <samp>FORMAT</samp> to access and input invisible formatting characters used to control direction, joining forms, etc.</p>

<!-- TRANSLITERATE AND MAKE VOCAB TEXT -->

<p><b class="leadin">Transliterate.</b> Converts the contents of the text area to a Latin transliteration that provides a one-to-one correspondence between  Turoyo and Latin symbols.</p>
<p>The transliteration scheme  was developed for this character app, and, where possible, uses  symbols that represent sounds typically associated with their Turoyo equivalents, rather than the sometimes fairly arbitrary selection of diacritics found in other systems. Of course, the complexities of mapping graphemes to sounds means that this is far from a real phonetic transcription,  and it doesn't show  vowels for unvowelled text, but the process is reversible (unlike most  transcriptions).</p>
<p>Transliterations produced this way are particularly useful for understanding the composition of text in  scripts, where the individual parts are not well separated in the text.</p>



<!--
<p><b class="leadin">Make vocab.</b> This helps speed up the creation of entries for the <a href="../../../app-vocab/">vocabulary app</a>. You can create a vocab item with up to 5 parts, delimited by / or |, in the following order: </p>
<ol>
<li>native text</li>
<li>meaning</li>
<li>transcription (IPA or other, optional)</li>
<li>alternative transcription (if needed)</li>
<li>notes (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 80%;">Hint: For RTL script character apps it often helps to set the direction of the text area to LTR. (To do this, click on the ‚ÜíÔ∏é arrow below the bottom right of the text area.)</p>
<p>The basic transcription should be in IPA, wherever possible. You can also add an alternative transcription, such as an ISO or LOC transcription. This will be styled differently from the IPA.</p>
<p>Much of the time, only the first 2 items are needed. In this app if an IPA transcription is not supplied it will be added automatically, though it should be checked carefully.</p>
<p>Here is an example of before and after.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>/sky</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code><span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>|sky|meÀêk</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The app will automatically generate a Latin transcription in parentheses if the Latin orthography differs from the IPA.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="fuf">û§ºû§Æû§©û§Æ</span>|rain</code></p>
<p>will produce:</p>
<p><code><span lang="fuf">û§ºû§Æû§©û§Æ</span>|rain|t…î…ì…î (to…ìo)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The app will also, simultaneously, produce markup for examples in the secondary text area (see below).</p>
<p>If you have more than one line of text in the text area, you must highlight the line you want to convert. Only convert one line at a time.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Vocab to markup.</b> Converts a vocab entry to markup that can be used for an example. Must be applied to one line at a time.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: cornsilk; padding: 0.1em 1em; border-radius: .5em; font-size: 90%;">
<p><code><span lang="km">·ûò·üÅ·ûÉ</span>|sky|meÀêk</code></p>
