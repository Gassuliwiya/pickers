<p>This Unicode character picker allows you to produce or analyse runs of Dhivehi/Thaana text. Character pickers are especially useful for people who don't know a script well, as characters are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>
<p>If something is broken or missing <a target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/issues/new?title=[thaana%20picker]%20%20ADD%20TITLE%20HERE">let me know</a>. For version information see <a  target="_blank" style="font-size:110%;" href="https://github.com/r12a/pickers/commits/gh-pages/thaana">the Github commit list</a>.</p>


<section id="basics">
  <h2 href="#basics">Basic use</h2>
<p>To produce characters in the text area, click on character shapes, or use your keyboard for Latin characters, delete, etc. Then cut &amp; paste the result to your document, or use the controls to get further information about the characters. You must have JavaScript enabled. </p>
<p><b class="leadin">Sample text</b> If you want to add some sample text to the text area, click on the <img src="../../images/sample.png" alt="plus sign"/> icon.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Fonts</b>
To properly display the text you will need to choose a font that is loaded on your system or device, or use the web font downloaded with the page (Noto Sans Thaana). The font list indicates which fonts are standard for Mac (Snow Leopard/Lion) and Windows7. See more information about <a href="/scripts/fontlist/#thaana">standard OS fonts in Mac and Windows</a>.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Mobile devices</b>
When working on an iPad or similar device, you should turn off<code class="kw" translate="no"> Autofocus</code> (just below the text area). This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.  You may also need to select a character twice to add it to the output field.</p>
</section>

<section id="about">
<h2 href="#about">About the chart</h2>
      <p>Includes all characters in the Unicode <a href="/uniview/?block=thaana" target="_blank">Thaana</a> block.     </p>
      <p>All text is output in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character - text pasted into the box won't be normalised until you click on another character above, or click on a button in the yellow area.</p>

<section id="text_area">
  <h3 href="#text_area">Text area</h3>
  <p><img src="images/text_area.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>This is where you see characters appearing as you select them from the panels lower down or where you paste text into the picker. Once you have some text here, you can perform various operations on it, or simply copy it to the clipboard for use elsewhere. </p>
  <p>The controls just above the text area allow you to interactive with the text in various ways. They mostly work on highlighted text within the text area, or if there is no highlight they work on all the text. Controls near the bottom of the picker allow you to change font, font size, line-height, text direction, etc.</p>
</section>



<section id="buttons">
  <h3 href="#buttons">Selection area</h3>
  <p><img src="images/selection_area.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Click on characters or buttons in this area to add them to the  text area above.</p>
  <p>Consonants appear in the middle, vowels to the right. The last two rows of the consonant block contain characters for transcription of Arabic (and in one case English) sounds, and the deprecated naviyani consonant.</p>
</section>



<section id="top_controls">
  <h3 href="#top_controls">Controls above the text area</h3>
      <p><img src="images/controls_above.png" alt=""/></p>
      <p>Controls above the input box allow you to run various operations on the text in the box. <strong>Most of them work on what you have selected</strong> within the box, or the whole box if nothing is selected.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Copy, select, delete, etc. (<img src="images/copy_etc.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt=""/>).</b> The icons on the left above the input box allow you (listing them from left to right) to copy the text to the clipboard, select the text, or delete it, generate a URL to share with others that will reproduce for them what you see in the text box, add some sample text to the text area, and open this help file. </p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Show codepoints.</b> Produces a list of the Unicode code points in the input box. You can usually follow a link from a code point item to more detailed information about that character.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Convert to escapes.</b> Opens a new window for the converter app, which shows various different ways of representing the text in the input box using escapes.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Make example.</b> This may be useful to speed up the creation of examples. You can create an example with four parts, delimited by /, in the following order: [1] Thaana text, [2] IPA transcription, [3] other transcription, [4] meaning. You don't need to add all four elements, but if you want to skip one in the middle of the sequence, use //.</p>
       <p>For example, the following (which is displayed here more as you'd type it than see it, because of the bidi algorithm effect):</p>
      <p><span lang="dv">ދިވެހި</span>/ḏiʋehi/dhivehi/Dhivehi</p>
      <p>will produce:</p>
      <p style="text-align:left; text-justify:auto;"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;ex&quot; lang=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;<span lang="dv">ދިވެހި</span>&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ipa&quot;&gt;ḏiʋehi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;dhivehi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;Dhivehi&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
      <p>To get just the armenian and the meaning you would use:</p>
       <p><span lang="dv">ދިވެހި</span>///Dhivehi</p>
       
      
      <p><b class="leadin">Character markup.</b> This may be useful to speed up the creation of markup for a specific character or set of characters. Select one or more characters in the text area, then click this button.  It will return something like the following for each of the characters:</p>
      <p style="text-align:left; text-justify:auto;"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;codepoint&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;&amp;#x25CC;&amp;#x0787;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;uname&quot;&gt;U+0787 THAANA LETTER ALIFU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
      <p>When you add it to your document, it will look like this.</p>
      <p><span class="codepoint"><span lang="dv">&#x0787;</span> <span class="uname">U+0787 THAANA LETTER ALIFU</span></span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="secondary_output">Secondary text area</h3>
  <p><img src="images/secondary_text.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>This area receives the output of various tools. Note that the text is editable.</p>
  <p>The icons to the right ( <img src="images/second_copy_etc.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle;"/> ) allow you to copy the contents of this area to the clipboard, insert the contents into the main text area, or close this subwindow, respectively. When you insert the contents of this subwindow into the main text area, the text will overwrite any highlighted text, otherwise it will just be inserted at the current cursor position.</p>
  <p>Some conversions produce ambiguous output. In this case, you will be offered two alternatives on a yellow background, eg. <img src="images/alternatives.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;"/> presents you with the alternatives 'h' or 't'. Simply click on the alternative you want, and the picker will discard the rest.</p>
</section>

<section id="character_names">
  <h3 href="#character_names">Character names</h3>
  <p><img src="images/character_names.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>As you mouse over characters in the selection areas of the picker, you will see the code point and character name appear here. </p>
</section>

<section id="autofocus">
  <h3 href="#autofocus">Autofocus &amp; base direction</h3>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="images/autofocus.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>When working on an iPad or similar device, you should set this to <samp>Off</samp>. This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.</p>
  <p>The characters  → ↔ ←︎︎︎ allow you to set the base direction of the text area to LTR, auto, and RTL, respectively.</p>
</section>

<section id="input_aids">
  <h3 href="#input_aids">Input aids</h3>
    <p><img src="images/input_aids.png" style="float:left; margin-right:1em; " alt=""/></p>
    <p>The vertical grey bar to the left allows you to turn on/off a number of panels that can help create the text you want.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Default.</b> Turns off all input aids and closes all panels.</p>
      <p><b class="leadin">Hinting.</b> Changes the selection area so that, when you mouse over a character, characters that are similar in appearance, and may be easily confused, are automatically highlighted. This can be particularly useful for people who are not familiar with the script, to avoid confusing similar characters, or to find the right character when two or more look similar.    </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Latin characters.</b> Displays a panel of lowercase Latin characters you are likely to need for  transcription.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Maldivian Latin to Thaana.</b> Displays a panel that allows you to generate Thaana text from characters used for the official Maldivian Latin transcription. Click on the transcription character and the appropriate Thaana character will be produced. Where there are multiple possible choices, these choices are presented in a small pop-up box; click on the choice you want in order to add it to the text area</p>
</section>



<section id="yellow_controls">
  <h3 href="#yellow_controls">Controls on the yellow background</h3>
    <p><img src="images/yellow_controls.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Left-hand controls.</b> These controls at the bottom of the page allow you to modify fonts used, the font size, line height, and the height of the text area. </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Add codepoint.</b> You can add characters to the text area by typing codepoints and escapes in the <samp>Add codepoint</samp> field and hitting return. This will accept HTML numeric character references, javascript and other programming escapes, U+ Unicode notation, or just simple codepoint numbers separated by spaces. All codepoint numbers (including those in escapes) must be hexadecimal.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Search for. </b>If you are searching for a particular character and know (at least part of) the name or the codepoint, type that in the search box and hit return. All characters with matching text in the name or codepoint number will be highlighted. The highlighting is only removed when you click on the <samp translate="no">X</samp> next to the search input field. You can also use regular expression syntax to improve your search results. For example, to find the letter 'ha', but not 'gha' etc, you can use <kbd  translate="no">\bha\b</kbd> (or the shortcut, <kbd  translate="no">:ha:</kbd>).</p>
</section>
<section id="more_controls">
  <h3 href="#more_controls">More controls</h3>
  <p><img src="images/more_controls.png" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Click on <samp>more controls</samp> to reveal the less commonly used controls described here.</p>
  <p><b class="leadin">Normalise. </b>All text is added to the main text area in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character – text pasted into the box won't be normalised until you click on another character above, or click on a button in the yellow area. </p>
  <p><b class="leadin">Change table font. </b>Allows you to change the font and size of the characters you click on in the main selection areas. </p>
    <p><b class="leadin">CC base.</b> You would normally expect combining characters, such as accents and vowel signs, when displayed alone to be associated with a dotted circle, however these font glyphs are <a href="http://rishida.net/blog/?p=1433">handled inconsistently</a> from one browser/font to the next. The picker is set up for a given web font initially, but if you change the table font you may need to do something to ensure that combining characters display in a way that helps you click on them. </p>
    <p>The <samp class="kw" translate="no">CC base</samp> control allows you to specify a base character that will be used before each combining character (or no base character). This should hopefully help for most font and browser combinations.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">Table direction.</b> Allows you to flip the direction of the selection area. </p>
